The goal of my bachelor's thesis is the automated evaluation of measurement data of a Force/Torque Sensor. A graphical user interface was created to make it easy for the user to work with its data. The Force Sensor is connected to a beared engine and this allows to get its Forces and Torques. Another task of my work was to implement some optional functions which the user can use - to save the data automated in Excel, for example.

Before programing, a literature research about the used Force Sensor was done, to get the know-how, how the Software should look for a easy use.

In the end the program was tested on an engine to guarantee a good working Software.

This work is a perfect mechatronic task. In addition to the measuring structure, it also includes software development as well as the connection to electrical machines.
