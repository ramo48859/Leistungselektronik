abstract = {A myriad of IoT applications, ranging from tracking assets in hospitals, logistics, and construction industries to indoor tracking in large indoor spaces, demand centimeter-accurate localization that is robust to blockages from hands, furniture, or other occlusions in the environment. With this need, in the recent past, Ultra Wide Band (UWB) based localization and tracking has become popular. Its popularity is driven by its proposed high bandwidth and protocol specifically designed for localization of specialized "tags". This high bandwidth of UWB provides a fine resolution of the time-of-travel of the signal that can be translated to the location of the tag with centimeter-grade accuracy in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, we find that high latency and high-power consumption of these time-of-travel methods are the major culprits which prevent such a system from deploying multiple tags in the environment. Thus, we developed ULoc, a scalable, low-power, and cm-accurate UWB localization and tracking system. In ULoc, we custom build a multi-antenna UWB anchor that enables azimuth and polar angle of arrival (henceforth shortened to '3D-AoA') measurements, with just the reception of a single packet from the tag. By combining multiple UWB anchors, ULoc can localize the tag in 3D space. The single-packet location estimation reduces the latency of the entire system by at least 3\texttimes{}, as compared with state of art multi-packet UWB localization protocols, making UWB based localization scalable. ULoc's design also reduces the power consumption per location estimate at the tag by 9\texttimes{}, as compared to state-of-art time-of-travel algorithms. We further develop a novel 3D-AoA based 3D localization that shows a stationary localization accuracy of 3.6 cm which is 1.8\texttimes{} better than the state-of-the-art two-way ranging (TWR) systems. We further developed a temporal tracking system that achieves a tracking accuracy of 10 cm in mobile conditions which is 4.3\texttimes{} better than the state-of-the-art TWR systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultra-wideband technology has the merits of high temporal resolution and stability, and it has been widely used for high-accuracy localization and tracking. However, most ultra-wideband localization systems need multiple anchors for trilateration, which results in high system cost, large messages overhead, and insufficient extraction of information. In this paper, we propose a single-anchor localization (SAL) mehtod that achieves high-accuracy multi-agent localization with high efficiency. In the proposed method, the anchor broadcasts the first two messages and then each agent responds one message to the anchor (quasi-)simultaneously. Based on the received message with superpositioned agent responses, the time-of-flight and angle-of-arrival information from all agents to the anchor can be extracted altogether. We implement the localization system in two indoor environments, and show that the proposed method can achieve decimeter-level accuracy for multiple agents using three messages. Our method provides design guidelines for high-accuracy and high-efficiency multi-agent localization systems.},

abstract = {We present SurePoint, a system for drop-in, high-fidelity indoor localization. SurePoint builds on recently available commercial ultra-wideband radio hardware. While ultra-wideband radio hardware can provide the timing primitives necessary for a simple adaptation of two-way ranging, we show that with the addition of frequency and spatial diversity, we can achieve a 53\% decrease in median ranging error. Because this extra diversity requires many additional packets for each range estimate, we next develop an efficient broadcast ranging protocol for localization that ameliorates this overhead. We evaluate the performance of this ranging protocol in stationary and fast-moving environments and find that it achieves up to 0.08 m median error and 0.53 m 99th percentile error. As ranging requires the tag to have exclusive access to the channel, we next develop a protocol to coordinate the localization of multiple tags in space. This protocol builds on recent work exploiting the constructive interference phenomenon. The ultra-wideband PHY uses a different modulation scheme compared to the narrowband PHY used by previous work, thus we first explore the viability and performance of constructive interference with ultra-wideband radios. Finally, as the ranging protocol requires careful management of the ultra-wideband radio and tight timing, we develop TriPoint, a dedicated "drop-in" ranging module that provides a simple I2C interface. We show that this additional microcontroller demands only marginal energy overhead while facilitating interoperability by freeing the primary microcontroller to handle other tasks.},

abstract = {Setting up indoor localization systems is often excessively time-consuming and labor-intensive, because of the high amount of anchors to be carefully deployed or the burdensome collection of fingerprints. In this paper, we present SALMA, a novel low-cost UWB-based indoor localization system that makes use of only one anchor and that does neither require prior calibration nor training. By using only a crude floor plan and by exploiting multipath reflections, SALMA can accurately determine the position of a mobile tag using a single anchor, hence minimizing the infrastructure costs, as well as the setup time. We implement SALMA on off-the-shelf UWB devices based on the Decawave DW1000 transceiver and show that, by making use of multiple directional antennas, SALMA can also resolve ambiguities due to overlapping multipath components. An experimental evaluation in an office environment with clear line-of-sight has shown that 90\% of the position estimates obtained using SALMA exhibit less than 20 cm error, with a median below 8 cm. We further study the performance of SALMA in the presence of obstructed line-of-sight conditions, moving objects and furniture, as well as in highly dynamic environments with several people moving around, showing that the system can sustain decimeter-level accuracy with a worst-case average error below 34 cm.},

TITLE = {Improving Deep Learning-Based {UWB} {LOS/NLOS} Identification with Transfer Learning: An Empirical Approach},
JOURNAL = {Electronics},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an improved ultra-wideband (UWB) line of sight (LOS)/non-line of sight (NLOS) identification scheme based on a hybrid method of deep learning and transfer learning. Previous studies have limitations, in that the classification accuracy significantly decreases in an unknown place. To solve this problem, we propose a transfer learning-based NLOS identification method for classifying the NLOS conditions of the UWB signal in an unmeasured environment. Both the multilayer perceptron and convolutional neural network (CNN) are introduced as classifiers for NLOS conditions. We evaluate the proposed scheme by conducting experiments in both measured and unmeasured environments. Channel data were measured using a Decawave EVK1000 in two similar indoor office environments. In the unmeasured environment, the existing CNN method showed an accuracy of approximately 44%, but when the proposed scheme was applied to the CNN, it showed an accuracy of up to 98%. The training time of the proposed scheme was measured to be approximately 48 times faster than that of the existing CNN. When comparing the proposed scheme with learning a new CNN in an unmeasured environment, the proposed scheme demonstrated an approximately 10% higher accuracy and approximately five times faster training time.},
